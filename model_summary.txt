The cat is a small and weak cat that was huddled on the side of the road in heavy rain. It was soaked and pitiful, lay in a torn cardboard box, and has soft, smooth white fur. Its eyes are round and sad, its body trembled from the cold, and its big ears are always pricked up. It is smart, not only good at catching mice but also very affectionate. It knows how to appreciate food very much, even if the rice is empty, it still eats very cleanly and neatly. The author loves this cat very much and promises to help many other unfortunate cats out there.
